# Data Journalism with D3
This project features a scatter plot using US Census data, Javascript, and D3.   The x and y axis variables can be selected by a user.   Upon selection of the axis, the axis labels change to match the min and max values for the selection.    A mouseover will produce a tool tip with more details on the values.   

Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
